- Simple fps counter and opengl project.
  I used GL/glut.h library

- First of all I'm aware that the code is too complicated but I'm too busy to fix it. 
I use this app just to have fun with cpp, I have no purpose just to enjoy and learn a few things.
- By the way so many code not running i know.
